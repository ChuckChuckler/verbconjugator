## What is it?
This is a simple practice website I made in a couple of hours to practice Latin. It has two modes, conjugation practice and verb formation practice.

## How do I use it?
Simply click on either of the buttons. It's pretty self-explanatory, but:
* The "conjugate" button will generate a verb for you to conjugate.
* The "form" button will generate a verb's description (e.g., 3rd person singular indicative pluperfect), and it's up to you to form the verb.
Other instructions specific to each button will display on the website.
